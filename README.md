Simple Scala Graph
====================

What Is It?
---------------------

This is an extremely simple in memory graph store. It was originally developed
for the Empire Windrush project (At this time still in stealth development
mode). While there are other powerful graph libraries for Scala (most notably)
Graph4Scala, this one is far simpler, and could serve as a good learning tool.
